<p>This is a Java client adapter for Avalara AvaTax web services.  This version has support for the tax and 
address services.</p>
<p>The adapter was built using Apache Axis WSDL2Java to build the stubs which 
  were then enhanced to support a custom Profile SOAP header element and a WS-Security 
  UsernameToken SOAP header element.</p>
<p>A set of JUnit tests are provided as examples. You may wish to refer to .NET/COM 
  documentation for more details.</p>
<p><strong>YOU MUST CONFIGURE avatax4j.properties before running tests or samples!</strong><br>
  Use avatax4j.properties.sample as an example and insert your account and license.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>All dependent jar files are included for build and running.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp" target="_blank"> 
    JDK 5.0</a> or later 
    <ul>
      <li>avatax4j should be compatible with <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html" target="_blank">J2SDK 
        1.4.2</a> , but we no longer provide support for this version. You will 
        need to use the cacert file from JDK 5.0.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi" target="_blank">Apache Ant 
    1.6.x</a> or later</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Look at the examples in the samples directory.</li>
  <li>Look at the unit tests for more examples.</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="doc/api/index.html">Javadocs</a></li>
  <li>Configure avatax4j.properties.Use avatax4j.properties.sample as an example 
    and insert your account and license.</li>
  <li>Run the samples and unit tests. See build instructions below.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Build Instructions</h2>
<p>A complete Ant build.xml script is provided in the root directory. Here is 
  a list of the main target Ant tasks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>compile - compiles everything</li>
  <li>javadoc - builds the javadocs</li>
  <li>test - runs the junit tests</li>
  <li>clean - cleans up all generated files and directories</li>
  <li>jar - creates the avatax4j.jar file</li>
  <li>usage - provides help on using the build tool (default)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>Many applications will only need to deploy the avatax4j.jar and avatax4j.properties 
  file. The avatax4j.properties file can be eliminated by setting the server url, 
  username and password credentials in your code. Examples of this can be found 
  in any of the samples (e.g. TestConnectionSample).</p>
<p>Some applications may require deployment of additional jar files from the lib 
  folder. These are all standard Sun, Apache, or other open-source components. 
  The version is indicated in most of the jar file names, but avatax4j should 
  be generally compatible with later versions. The axis-ant.jar, junit.jar, wsdl4j.jar 
  are only used for building and testing avatax4j.</p>
<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p>The changes in this release are primarily to support our upcoming high-availability 
  initiative (AvaTax 6.0) which will provide multiple live AvaTax sites, called 
  Tax Calculation Centers or TCCs.&nbsp; This new release eliminates the DocId 
  property for all operations.&nbsp; Instead, clients will need to use DocCode 
  instead of DocId.&nbsp; DocCode is specified by the client and typically represents 
  an order or invoice number. Site specific DocIds are not compatible with a multi-site, 
  highly-available architecture. We will maintain support for clients using earlier 
  adapters, but they will not be able to take advantage of the new high-availability 
  architecture. If you are developing a new client, then these changes do not 
  affect you.</p>
<h2>Change History</h2>
<h4>11.4</h4>
<p>In this release we have exposed the ability to specify a latitude and longitude as part of the address.</p>

<h4>5.8.0</h4>
<p>This release adds the new AvaCertSvc web service interface. AvaCert is a new web-hosted, exemption certificate management service which automates the collection and management of exemption certificates. See <a href="http://www.avalara.com" target="_blank">www.avalara.com</a> for details. An AvaCert subscription is required to use this service. Contact <a href="http://www.avalara.com" target="_blank">Avalara Sales</a> to sign-up or find out more.</p>
<h4>5.7.1 - April 2010</h4>
<p>This version contains the changes to support AvaTax Tax Calculation Centers 
  (our upcoming high availability solution). This adapter version will work with 
  the AvaTax 5.7 and later service versions. It is intended to prepare clients 
  for our upcoming AvaTax HA (6.0) release. It contains changes that may require 
  code changes for existing changes. These are necessary to work with AvaTax HA 
  services and Tax Calculation Centers. </p>
<p><strong>1. Eliminated use of Document Ids</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The DocId properties have been removed from the interface. Document Ids are 
    internal, persistent identifiers for a specific document. AvaTax 5.6 and earlier 
    adapters returned a DocId from GetTax which could optionally be used for subsequent 
    calls to other methods such as PostTax. In the HA environment, DocIds are 
    not assigned until the document reaches the Primary Data Center; therefore, 
    DocIds are not available from a TCC (Tax Calculation Center). Use of DocId 
    has always been optional as an alternative to specifying the CompanyCode, 
    DocType and DocCode. The DocId properties have been removed from the interface 
    in this adapter version. Clients that are not using DocIds will continue to 
    work with no changes. Those using DocIds will need to switch to using DocCodes. 
  </p>
  <p>DocId has been removed from the following types. Use DocCode and CompanyCode 
    instead of DocId. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>GetTaxResult <br>
      PostTaxRequest <br>
      PostTaxResult <br>
      CommitTaxRequest <br>
      CommitTaxResult <br>
      CancelTaxRequest <br>
      CancelTaxResult <br>
      ApplyPaymentRequest <br>
      ApplyPaymentResult </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. Added NewDocCode to PostTax and CommitTax</strong></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"> AvaTax allows clients to change the DocCode when calling 
    PostTax or CommitTax.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is typically used to assign 
    an invoice number during posting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If 
    your application uses this capability, you will need to make some minor code 
    changes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>DocId was previously 
    used to identify the document and DocCode was used to indicate the new document 
    code.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"> The DocId property on the PostTaxRequest and CommitTaxRequest 
    has been replaced with a NewDocCode property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>DocCode is now used to identify the existing document instead of DocId.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NewDocCode indicates the new 
    DocCode.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>3. Removed HashCode from the following types. This 
    has not proven to be useful and will be replaced with a better mechanism in 
    AvaTax 6.0.</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="MsoNormal">GetTaxRequest <br>
      GetTaxResult <br>
      PostTaxRequest </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>4. ReconcileTaxHistory Changes</strong></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A number of changes have been made to ReconcileTaxHistory 
    to eliminate DocIds and provide additional filtering options.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">ReconcileTaxHistoryRequest</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>DocType has been added as a filter. This allows filtering on SalesInvoices 
      or other specific types.. A new enum value of DocumentType.Any can be used 
      to return all types of documents.<br>
      LastDocId has been replaced with LastDocCode which is used for paging through 
      the history. Results are now returned sorted by DocCode instead of DocId.<br>
      PageSize has been added to indicate the number of records to return. This 
      defaults to 1000 as before.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>ReconcileTaxHistoryResult</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>LastDocId has been replaced with LastDocCode. <br>
      RecordCount has been added to indicate the total number of records in the 
      ReconcileTaxHistoryResult. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>5. TaxDetail StateAssignedCode</strong></p>
  <p>StateAssignedNo has been added to the TaxDetail class. StateAssignedNo indicates 
    the identifier given to the location by the state. </p>
  </blockquote>
<h4>5.3.1 - March 2009</h4>
<p>Several properties were added and some behavioral changes were made for the 
  existing ones. </p>
<p>GetTaxRequest class</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ExchangeRate</font> has been added. 
    ExchangeRate indicates the currency exchange rate from the transaction currency 
    (indicated by CurrencyCode) to the company base currency. This only needs 
    to be set if the transaction currency is different than the company base currency. 
    It defaults to 1.0. </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ExchangeRateEffDate</font> has been 
    added. ExchangeRateEffDate indicates the effective date of the exchange rate. 
    It should be set in conjunction with ExchangeRate. It will default to the 
    DocDate if not set. </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PaymentDate</font> has been added. 
    PaymentDate indicates the date when payment was received for the document. 
    It is only applicable for cash-basis accounting and does not need to be set 
    otherwise. It defaults to 1/1/1900 which indicates no payment. The new TaxSvc.ApplyPayment 
    method may be used to apply a payment to an existing invoice.<br>
    Note: The ReportingDate for a cash-basis invoice will be set to 12/31/9999. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>GetTaxResult class</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TotalTaxCalculated</font> has been 
    added. TotalTaxCalculated indicates the total tax calculated by AvaTax. This 
    is usually the same as the TotalTax, except when a tax override amount is 
    specified. This is for informational purposes. The TotalTax will still be 
    used for reporting. </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxSummary</font> has been added. 
    TaxSummary is now returned when GetTaxRequest.DetailLevel == DetailLevel.Line 
    in addition to DetailLevel.Summary. It is not returned for DetailLevel.Document 
    or DetailLevel.TaxDetail. </li>
</ul>
<p>TaxDetail class</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">RateType</font> has been added. 
    RateType indicates the tax rate type. These currently include: 
    <ul>
      <li>F = Food (US) </li>
      <li>G = General (US) </li>
      <li>S = Standard (VAT) </li>
      <li>R = Reduced (VAT)</li>
      <li> Q = Super Reduced (VAT) </li>
      <li>A = Reduced Rate 1 (VAT) </li>
      <li>B = Reduced Rate 2 (VAT) </li>
      <li>Z = Zero Rate </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxCalculated</font> has been added. 
    TaxCalculated indicates the tax calculated by AvaTax. It will usually be the 
    same as the Tax property, unless it has been overridden by a TaxOverride.TaxAmount.</li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxGroup</font> has been added. 
    TaxGroup indicates the group code when special grouping is enabled for particular 
    client applications. For other clients, it will be empty. Line class</li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxIncluded</font> has been added. 
    TaxIncluded indicates the tax amount has already been included in the line 
    Amount. The tax will be reversed out and returned in the TaxLine.Tax property. 
    The TaxLine.Taxable property will indicate the calculated tax base amount. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>TaxLine class</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxCalculated</font> has been added. 
    TaxCalculated indicates the tax calculated by AvaTax. This will normally be 
    the same as the Tax property unless it has been overridden by a TaxOverride.TaxAmount. 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TaxIncluded</font> has been added. 
    TaxIncluded indicates the tax has already been included in the line item prices. 
    When true, the Tax property will indicate reversed out tax amount and the 
    Taxable property will indicate the calculated tax base amount. </li>
</ul>
<p>TaxSvc class</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ApplyPayment</font> has been added. 
    ApplyPayment allows a payment to be applied to an invoice for companies using 
    cash-basis accounting. It will update the PaymentDate and ReportingDate for 
    that invoice. Until a payment is applied to cash-basis invoices, the ReportingDate 
    will be set to 12/31/9999 to prevent the invoice from being reported. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.2.0.0 - August 2008</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>AddressSvc.Validate: </strong>Added a Taxability flag to the ValidateRequest 
    to retrieve whether the address is a taxable address. This is indicated by 
    the ValidateResult.Taxable flag.</li>
  <li><strong>TaxSvc.ApplyPayment</strong>: This is a new method for applying 
    payments to invoices. This only applies to companies that have CashBasisEnabled 
    and in US states or countries where the AccountingMethod is set to CashBasis 
    in the Nexus for that state or country. CashBasis invoices are not considered 
    reportable until payment has been applied. ApplyPayment will set the Line.ReportingDates 
    to the PaymentDate. Otherwise, it will be left at 9999-12-31 and won't show 
    on reports.</li>
  <li><strong>TaxSvc.GetTax</strong>: 
    <ol>
      <li type="a">A new TaxOveride element was added to the GetTaxRequest and 
        the Line. This allows specifying an overriding tax date and tax amount, 
        or overriding the exempt status.</li>
      <li>CurrencyCode was added. The default is USD, if not specified.</li>
      <li>PaymentDate was added to GetTaxRequest which allows applying a payment 
        to a cash basis transaction when calculating tax.</li>
      <li>ExchangeRate and ExchangeRateEffDate were added to GetTaxRequest to 
        indicate the rate of currency exchange relative to the company's base 
        currency. This defaults to 1. It should only be set if the transaction 
        currency is different than the company's base currency. The rate should 
        be TransactionCurrency * ExchangeRate = BaseCurrency.</li>
      <li>TotalTaxCalculated has been added to the GetTaxResult and TaxCalculated 
        has been added to TaxLine and TaxDetail. This indicates the tax that AvaTax 
        calculated in cases where a TaxOverride was used.</li>
      <li>TaxSummary was added to the GetTaxResult which contains a summary of 
        taxes by jurisdiction. This is only returned when the GetTaxRequest.DetailLevel 
        is Summary or Line.</li>
      <li>A new global JurisType of Country is now returned for foreign countries, 
        including Canada. Previously State and County were used for Canada and 
        Province jurisdictions. To prevent breaking existing clients, this same 
        behavior is retained unless the Profile.Name is set to &quot;5.1.0&quot; 
        or later. In general, the version of the avatax4j release should be used 
        in the Profile.Name. For this release, it should be Profile.Name = &quot;5.2.0.0&quot;.</li>
    </ol>

<h4>4.15.0 - June 2007</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Eliminated backward compatibility issue with AvaTax server API changes. 
    Previously if new elements were added to the server api, it was necessary 
    to either get a new adapter or make sure that the avatax4j.jar preceeded axis.jar 
    on the classpath. This was problematic or not possible in some environments. 
    We are handling this issue now and no longer depend on the classpath order. 
    Updating the adapter for server API changes is not necessary except when you 
    wish to use the new features. Backward compatibility will be maintained. We 
    highly recommend updgrading to this new adapter. No code changes should be 
    necessary. The interface has not been changed.</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.14.0 - May 2007</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Eliminated need for wss4j-1.1.0.jar, opensaml-1.0.1.jar, and xmlsec-1.2.1.jar 
    files. The SOAP security token is now directly built in BaseSvcSoapStub.setSecurity(). 
    The only required code change is in the wsdd configuration. See the next change 
    for details.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Eliminated the need for the avatax4j.wsdd file. You should simply call the 
    default AddressSvcLocator() or TaxSvcLocator() constructor instead of passing 
    a config file (new FileProvider(&quot;avatax4j.wsdd&quot;)). If you wish to 
    still use a wsdd config file, then you need to remove the &lt;handler type=&quot;java:org.apache.ws.axis.security.WSDoAllSender&quot; 
    &gt; handler. This is because we no longer use wss4j. See any of the samples 
    or junit tests for code examples. The handler has been removed from the included 
    avataxj4.wsdd, but it isn't necessary if you just use the default locator 
    constructors. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Included the activation.jar and mailapi.jar files to eliminate the annoying, 
    but inocuous &quot;Unable to find required classes (javax.activation.DataHandler 
    and javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart). Attachment support is disabled&quot; 
    warning message.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you get a warning message regarding Xalan as follows:<br>
    <br>
    Unable to patch xalan function table.<br>
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: m_functions<br>
    at java.lang.Class.getField(Unknown Source)<br>
    at org.apache.xml.security.Init.registerHereFunction(Init.java:429)<br>
    at org.apache.xml.security.Init.init(Init.java:124)&#8230; (and so on)<br>
    <br>
    You need to copy the xalan-2.6.0.jar to your JAVA_HOME/lib/endorsed/ directory. 
    You may need to create the endorsed directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ant test target cannot find the junit task:<br>
    <br>
    The easiest way to fix this is to copy the junit jar from the avatax4j/lib 
    directory to your ant/lib directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Warning message: &quot;Unable to find required classes (javax.activation.DataHandler 
    and javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart). Attachment support is disabled&quot; 
    occurs. <br>
    <br>
    You need to include the activation.jar and mailapi.jar (included in releases 
    4.14.0 and later). Or you can download these at: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/downloads/index.html</a>
